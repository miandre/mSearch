 * Created by Mikael André on 2016-08-02.
 *
 * An object of this class is created for each word in the index of the search engine.
 *
 * The object contains a HashMap holding all documents in witch the current word occurs as the key, and the number of
 * occurrences in that document as the value. It also holds the total number of occurrences oc the word in all indexed
 * files. This may be used when normalizing the search result.
 *
 * The objec does not contain the actual word it represents, since each object is already mapped as the value to that
 * specific ford in the index of the search engine.
