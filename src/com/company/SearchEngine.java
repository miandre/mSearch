/**
 * Created by Micke on 2016-08-02.
 *
 * The SearchEngine object is the main part of the search engine.
 * The constructor first creates the index that is used in the actual search.
 * The index is in the form of a Hash map with the searchable words as keys,
 * and a {@Link IndexedWord} object as the value.
 *
 * Then the {@Link indexFiles()} method is called to index the files in the specified folder.
 * Finally, the search engine is implemented as an infinite loop where the user can search for single words.
